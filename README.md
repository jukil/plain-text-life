# Hi!

Welcome to the **Plain Text Life** project. This project consists of only
two elements:

1. The README you are reading right now,
2. The [today.txt](today.txt) template that assists you organising your everyday life
in plain text files. Create one copy of [today.txt](today.txt) for each day and use it
as your journal/diary, to set your goal of today, to structure your morning,
get done with your chores as quickly as possible, and to spend free time on
the things you love.

This template keeps your life structured in an easy to manage system and
thereby frees up time and mental capacity for the things that really matter in
life such as relationships and personal growth. By using this template, you
can de-clutter your life from using countless apps, and systems. Instead you
can choose to use plain text files that will always work, will always remain
readable by any computer and thus never become inaccessible.

# How to use it

1. Create a folder `Life` somewhere on your computer (Tip: you can also
  place this folder in a cloud folder, like Google Drive or Dropbox, to have
  it synced across devices).
2. Each day in the morning, after having set your coffee but before having
done any serious work, create a copy of `today.txt` and use today's date as
the filename like this: 2015-08-23.txt. This structure stands for YYYY-MM-DD.txt
and follows the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard.
3. Start writing by filling in blanks of the template.
4. Whenever you feel like, add your thoughts to the file using the syntax
below and hit save when you are done.

# Syntax

Although plain text files generally do not have a syntax, I recommend using
the default [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
Moreover, I advise you to separate elements with a blank line. Some examples:

    # Heading

    ## Sub-heading

    - list item

    todo: to mark a line as a todo for today

    done: to mark a line as done for today

    thought: to mark a line as a thought of today

    experience: to mark a line as an experience of today

    reflection: to mark a line as a reflection of today

    idea: to mark a line as an idea of today

    feeling: to mark a line as a feeling of today
    
    note: to mark a line as a useful information to remember of today

    @context to indicate the context of a line

    +project to indicate the project to which a line belongs to

    (A) (B) (C) to indicate the priority of a line

# Working with your plain text files

Start a software that indexes all your plain text files. On Linux I recommend
[Recoll](http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/download.html#general). Search for
keywords or tags that you remember and quickly find the right file you were
looking for.
